I recently completed my Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University with my thesis under the guidance of Dr. Chitta Baral.
I have, over time, learnt to value positivity, growth empathy and curiosity to learn and am now working to nurture these values in my life. 
Working with international teams and with systems on a global scale, my interests lie in solving complex problems, software engineering and machine learning.
